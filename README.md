Lingo Lemur

lingolemur.com

Sentiment analysis tool

Lingo Lemur uses natural language processing algorithms to determine the overall positivity, neutrality or negativity of a text input. The application allows users to receive sentiment analyses of books, articles, songs, tweets or reviews. 

The application filters binding, or ‘stop’ words such as ‘about’, ‘the’, and ‘so’ and awards positive, neutral or negative scores to words determined to have sentiment. The values are on a scale of 5 to -5:

4 to 5 = very positive
1 to 3  = positive
0  = neutral
- 1 to - 3 = negative
-4 to -5 = very negative

We are grateful to Finn Årup Nielsen, whose AFINN list we employ for sentiment scoring.

Code

Lingo Lemur is written in JavaScript and Node.js, with the following dependencies: 
* body-parser 
* express 
* lodash 
mongoose
chai
gulp
jshint
mocha

Examples

```
var text = “The restaurant had a splendid vibe, and the food was incredible. Just brilliant.”
```

The program filters ‘stop’ words and checks the scores of those remaining: 

```
if(afinn[sentimentWords[i]] === 4 || afinn[sentimentWords[i]] === 5) {
        if(returnValue.vPosTerms[sentimentWords[i]]) {
          returnValue.vPosTerms[sentimentWords[i]]++;
        }
```

Averages are calculated based on sentiment scores and word counts: 

```
returnValue.sentimentValue = returnValue.sentimentValue/counter;
```

returning the general sentiment: 

```
  if(returnValue.sentimentValue >= 4) {
    returnValue.sentiment = 'Very Positive';
  }
  return returnValue;
};

var returnValue = sentimentChecker(text);
```

Testing

The application runs chai and mocha tests on the sentiment features, routes and the server.
